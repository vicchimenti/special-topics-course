# Course Content System
*     This new content type is being created for the University Registrar
*     to host entries that are mapped from a Terminal 4 form which will be
*     filled out by professors to describe their course.
* 
*     The content type generated from the mapping of this form wioll be used
*     as a sortable, searchable content item managed by the organizer.js
*     and displayed on any primary page layout in the University
*     (Homepage, Landing Page, Standard Subpage).
* 
*     The intention is to create a single content type that can be mapped
*     to from any of the 32 departments in the university. This allows the
*     item to be displayed on individual department pages or on the
*     Registrar's master course list.
